# Global Electronics Retailer
#### - [Project Dataset]()

In response to the ongoing sea freight logistical challenges and political tensions in the manufacturing country, the Global Electronic Retailer is proactively seeking to expand its inventory for North American customers. This strategic initiative aims to ensure a consistent supply of products, enhancing customer satisfaction and maintaining market competitiveness.

#### ֎ Strategic Considerations:
♦ *Should we restock products with highest sales or highest profit margin?* <br>
♦ *What are the top 5 products we need to order in a large quantity?* <br>
♦ *What is the cost of ordering these products?* <br>
♦ *When the products will arrive?* <br>

#### ֎ Analysis outcome: Restocking products with highest sales in North America:
♦ *Feasibility: Restocking products with the highest sales is more feasible due to lower costs and shorter lead times.* <br>
♦ *Risk: Restocking high-sales products carries lower risk due to established demand and manageable supply chain timelines.* <br>
♦ *Benefits: While restocking high-margin products offers higher profitability per unit, restocking high-sales products ensures steady revenue and customer satisfaction.* <br>
