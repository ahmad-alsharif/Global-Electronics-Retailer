**֎ Analysis outcome: Restocking products with highest sales in North America**

**» Feasibility:**  Restocking products with the highest sales is more feasible due to lower costs and shorter lead times.

**» Risk:**  Restocking high-sales products carries lower risk due to established demand and manageable supply chain timelines.

**» Benefits:**  While restocking high-margin products offers higher profitability per unit, restocking high-sales products ensures steady revenue and customer satisfaction.
